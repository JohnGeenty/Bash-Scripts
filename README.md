# Bash-Scripts
These are BASH scripts that I have written which help CS 220 students 

Usage: You MUST create a .bashrc file and update your .bash_profile file with this line of code:
  export PATH=$PATH:~/bin
  
This will allow you to use the scripts as normal bash commands whenever you open terminal
